## Description

The Early Connect Project aims to bridge the gap between young people in education and apprenticeship opportunities by connecting them with employers and providers at an earlier stage. This initiative, in collaboration with UCAS, is part of a broader program that includes employer and school engagement.

Key Highlights:
Provides a new way for students in schools and colleges to explore apprenticeship options.
Collaborates with UCAS to enhance accessibility to apprenticeship pathways. (As of Nov 2024 UCAS are no longer part of this system)
Includes a digital workstream alongside employer and school engagement efforts.
Pilot launch in Autumn 2023, targeting three regions: North East, Lancashire, and London.
This project is designed to create stronger connections between education and employment, helping young people make informed career choices at the right time.`
